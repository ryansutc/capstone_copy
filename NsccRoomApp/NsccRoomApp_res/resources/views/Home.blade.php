                    <p> This website lets you search for classrooms, labs, meeting rooms and others within the Nova Scotia
                        Community College (NSCC) campuses. It was initially designed for NSCC students looking to find a free place to study
                        or work at a computer outside of classes which can be sometimes difficult.

                    <p>The website was created as part of a group project by NSCC students, Ryan Sutcliffe, Nick Bourque and Michael Sturdy
                    for their independent study Capstone Project in the winter of 2017.</p>
                    <h3><strong>Why NSCC Sucks?</strong></h3>
                    <p>The current website name is a friendly jab at the NSCC PeopleSoft group who are still ignoring our team&#39s
                        and faculty advisors&#39 requests for access to scheduling and meeting room data. We are still waiting for even
                        a boilerplate &#34please go away&#34 response from anyone in that elusive bureaucratic black hole.</p>
                    <p>Thanks to Christopher Scott in the NSCC Scheduling department who was able get us exported text file snapshots
                        of classroom bookings data and some of the meeting room data for campuses as a workaround.
                        In lieu of direct access to a live database we transformed, loaded and synced these snapshots
                        into our own backend database and used that information for the website instead.
