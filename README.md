# Capstone Project Repository (NSCC Room Scheduling Website)
Student Capstone Course Project at NSCC (Winter 2017)

## Description / Background
This is a website to view rooms in the Nova Scotia Community College (NSCC) Campuses and their availability
based on booking information provided by the college. The website was an experiment with PHP driven web pages
using the Laravel Framework and a mySQL backend database. 

This is an independent copy of the NSCC Schedule Project Repository for archiving purposes. Originally repository was under a fellow students private student repository. To prevent the repository from being lost when that account expires it was recreated here publically for safekeeping. 

This version is slightly updated for optimal displaying here: nsccsucks.xyz
